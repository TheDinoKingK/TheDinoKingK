### 'ello! I'm Kaveen, aka "The Dino King" on most platforms

I'm a kid who makes silly stuff online and has learned to code in a few languages and frameworks, hoping to get a programming job one day

most of this account's repos are personal projects or just things I learned from courses.

I've learned to code in
  \n**Node.JS**
  \n**Java**
  \n**HTML & CSS**
  \n**C++ (mainly in unreal engine)**
  \n**C# (mainly in unity)**
  \n**Tensorflow (and general deep learning knowledge)**
  \n**Python**

\nand I'm recently learning to use Linux and the Redhat ecosystem

\nIf you want to contact me about anything you can message me at Kaveencode365@gmail.com or discord at TheDinoKing
