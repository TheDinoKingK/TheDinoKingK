### 'ello! I'm Kaveen, aka "The Dino King" on most social media platforms

I'm a kid who makes many things online and have learned to code in a few languages and frameworks, hoping to get a programming job one day

most of this account's repos are personal projects I've been working on, mods, themes, websites, etc. 

The rest are some basic projects from when I was learning from tutorials

If you want to contact me about anything you can email me @Kaveencode365@gmail.com or message me on discord @TheDinoKing
